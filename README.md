------------------
There are mainly 2 types of **UI components** here.
### TextField
There are two types of Textfields to be seen, for both Font and Foreground color is set:
1. `SpaceTextTypeView`
   This view will take text as input and return an typewriter like animated TextView.
   When animation is finished it will give a callback (if needed).

3. `SpaceTextView`
   This view is configurable as it will take multiple inputs such as text, border color, border type and animation stats.
   You can set custom gradient to left half or right half of TextView as needed.

   You can also set animation for border in this View. You can rotate border giving a blink effect. Animation can be configurable either forward or backward.

### Button
`SpaceButtonView` is a simple cube like animating button. It will show text and border with corners and a cube like layout. 
On Click of this button, there will be a simple clicking animation and a haptic feedback.
